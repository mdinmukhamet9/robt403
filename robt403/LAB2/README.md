This is the README file for the LAB2 report.

The folder LAB2 contains all the packages that were created for the purpose of LAB2.
It also contains all the screenshots with appropriate names in order to see how it works
without a need of actually running each of the nodes.

This time I also uploaded PDF file with report, with explanation of each task and screenshots as well.
Codes for task1 is located in src/ folder, while nodes for tasks 2, 3 and 5 are located in scripts/

For the real robot we needed to change the code a little bit. So for the purpose of easy checking I just left the original codes as it stated in report and added upadates codes for real snake with addition in name _melodic
